        <p>
          I started my self-taught learning process by following online courses.
          Not surprisingly, the first programming language I picked up was Python due to its simplicity and high functionality.
          However, after a while I decided to learn a more opinionated language, Ruby with its framework on Rails (RoR).
          Making this change provided me with good programming practices that I still use to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge acquired in both, Python and Ruby, was vital when learning JavaScript, which with its library React, has won over my heart.

    </section>
