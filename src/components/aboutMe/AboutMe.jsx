        <h1>Front-End Developer</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I am Guillermo. A little bit about myselft is that I am a self-taught front-end developer.
          Not surprisingly, the first programming language I picked up was Python due to its simplicity and high functionality.
        </p>
        <p>After some time, I decided to learn a more opinionated language, Ruby with its framework on Rails (RoR).
          Making this change provided me with good programming practices that I still use to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge acquired in both, Python and Ruby, was vital for me when learning JavaScript/TypeScript, which with its library React, has won over my heart.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
